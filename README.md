# Rents in San Francisco

## Overview of Data
This data were collected by Dr. Kate Pennington, who scraped Craiglist rental postings of properties in the general San Francisco area from 2000 to 2018. The dataset contains 200,796 observations, each of which represents an individual unit, identified by a unique ID, Craiglist posting date, neighborhood, city, county, monthly rent price, number of beds/baths, size in terms of square feet, whether there is room in the apartment, the address, and a description.

## Visualizations
The following images show the visualizations created using the data. The written report contains the code necessary to reproduce the visualizations.

The map shows that the majority of the rental properties are clustered around the San Francisco Bay area, with a very high concentration in the city of San Francisco, as well as in the southern region of the Bay Area near Sunnyvale and San Jose. There also appear to be several outliers that are further north of the San Francisco Bay. The plot shows that the number of rentals posted was the highest in 2011, and the number of rentals posted appears to significantly increase from 2010 to 2011, with very little postings between 2000 and 2010. There also appears to be sharp drops in the number of rental postings between 2011 and 2012 and 2016 and 2017. Between 2011 and 2018, Santa Clara County consistently has the highest number of rentals posted compared to other counties.
